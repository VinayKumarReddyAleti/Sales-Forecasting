## Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to forecast retail sales. The project involves extensive feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to ensure high prediction accuracy. The notebook includes steps for preprocessing the data, engineering features, training models, and analyzing feature importance.

## Features

- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training using LightGBM
- Feature importance analysis
- Visualization of top features

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Sales-Forecasting.git
    cd Sales-Forecasting
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the notebook and execute the code:

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Open the `Machine Learning for Retail Sales Forecasting â€” Features Engineering.ipynb` notebook and run the cells.

### Example

Below is a high-level overview of what each section in the notebook does:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and clean the dataset.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that might help in predicting sales.
3. **Model Training**: Train a LightGBM model on the processed data.
4. **Feature Importance**: Analyze and visualize the importance of each feature used in the model.
